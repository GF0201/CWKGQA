    \item Notes: All rows and counts are copied directly from \texttt{intent\_workspace/artifacts/rules\_trigger\_frequency.csv} and converted to percentages with one decimal place. This table is short enough to include all rules; if future runs introduce many more rules, the main paper can show only the top-\emph{K} rows while keeping the full CSV as part of the artifacts. The notes also clarify that \texttt{rule\_v1} is audit-only, while \texttt{rule\_v1\_route} and \texttt{rule\_v1\_clarify} are behaviour-changing modes whose qualitative impact is illustrated in the case studies.
